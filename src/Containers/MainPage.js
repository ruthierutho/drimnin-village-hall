            <p>We hope you are all safe and well.

            As you will be aware we have had to postpone all our activities at the village hall due to the Covid 19 pandemic. 
            <br></br>
            During the lockdown we have directed our energies at becoming a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation SCO50259 and arranging for some essential repairs in the hall.
            <br></br>
            Hereâ€™s hoping that before too long we can get together again at a village hall occasion, whatever form that may take.
            <br></br>
            Best wishes
