            <p>We hope you are all safe and well.

            As you will be aware we have had to postpone all our activities at the village hall due to the Covid 19 pandemic. During the lockdown we have directed our energies at becoming a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation SCO50259 and arranging for some essential repairs in the hall.

            Hereâ€™s hoping that before too long we can get together again at a village hall occasion, whatever form that may take.
            <br></br>
            Best wishes
